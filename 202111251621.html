First Important distinction: Nationalism and Patriotism <br>
Nationalism is simply a subset of particularism (the opposite of cosmopolotism) that derives pride for a nation through some ethnic group<br><br>
&emsp; For example: white nationalism clarifies that being white is the ethnic barrier to white nationalism <br><br>


Nationalism is quite clearly problematic, but patriotism on its face doesn't seem as worrisome. However, patriotism inherently means that there is a brighter line between someone who is part of a country and someone who is not. This, generally, means stricter <a href="#immigration" target="_blank">immigration</a> laws and unwillingness to maximize human wellbeing.<br><br>

&emsp; But, does being patriotic mean that you must now <i>love</i> are countries equally? <br><br>

Obviously it would be incredibly harmful to state that a country like Saudi Arabia is equally as respectable as the United States. I think the correct subset of particularism is constituional patriotism -- respect for the values of liberal democracies. In fact, you <i>must</i> be patriotic to create change. Not believing in principles that rely on consensus means that you cannot operate within the framework of the United States. All change outside of the framework is impossible (or at the very least short-lived), but the framework can be amended through a great enough consensus. <br><br>
